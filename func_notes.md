# Function.c Notes

#### My code with detailed notes of why I have written what i've written. The brute force code i've trialed and errored. ðŸ˜…

```#include <shell.h>

/*
 * function_name - Does something i'm yet to code
 * @command_name: The command to execute once i've given it a name
 * Return: '0' for success and '-1' for error (failure)
 */

int command_handler (char *input)
{

        return 0;
}
```
